#The answer is Supertrainerâ™€ Garvon with a Rayquaza!  The best pokemon is the pokemon that has the highest average of attack, special attack,
and speed.  Rayquaza probably the highest special attack, attack, and speed in pokemon so this analysis makes sense to me.  Pokemon that can
quickly attack with large numbers will always win.
